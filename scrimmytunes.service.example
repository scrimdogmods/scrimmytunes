# If you do not set these, ScrimmyTunes may run as root!  You've been warned!

# Replace mbdirectory same as above, also update the python path as needed for your system.

# Using on-failure allows the bot's shutdown command to actually stop the service.
# Using always will require you to stop the service via the service manager.
